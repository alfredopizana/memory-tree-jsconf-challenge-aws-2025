# Día de los Muertos Cultural Guidelines

## Cultural Sensitivity and Authenticity

When working on this family memory tree application, always maintain respect and authenticity for Mexican Day of the Dead traditions:

### Visual Design Principles
- Use traditional color palette: marigold orange (#FF6B35), deep purple (#8E44AD), gold (#F1C40F)
- Incorporate authentic decorative elements: cempasúchil (marigold flowers), papel picado, salt crosses, candles
- Distinguish between living and deceased family members with appropriate styling
- Avoid commercialized or Halloween-style imagery

### Cultural Elements to Include
- **Altar Levels**: Traditional three-level structure representing heaven (cielo), earth (tierra), and underworld (inframundo)
- **Offerings**: Visual representations of traditional offerings like bread, fruit, water, and favorite foods
- **Decorative Motifs**: Use traditional Mexican patterns and symbols respectfully
- **Typography**: Consider fonts that reflect Mexican cultural heritage without being stereotypical

### Language and Terminology
- Use respectful language when referring to deceased family members
- Include Spanish terms where appropriate with proper context
- Avoid reducing the tradition to just "Mexican Halloween"
- Emphasize celebration of life and remembrance, not mourning

### Implementation Guidelines
- Test visual elements with cultural consultants when possible
- Research traditional altar arrangements for authentic layouts
- Ensure decorative elements are culturally accurate, not generic
- Maintain dignity and reverence in all design choices

## Technical Standards for Cultural Elements

### Image Handling
- Support traditional aspect ratios for family photos
- Implement culturally-appropriate photo frame decorations
- Ensure high-quality rendering of decorative SVG elements
- Optimize for displaying traditional Mexican art patterns

### Accessibility
- Provide alt text that explains cultural significance of decorative elements
- Ensure color choices meet accessibility standards while maintaining cultural authenticity
- Support screen readers with meaningful descriptions of altar layouts

### Performance
- Optimize loading of decorative elements and cultural graphics
- Ensure smooth animations that enhance rather than distract from cultural elements
- Maintain performance across devices commonly used in target communities
