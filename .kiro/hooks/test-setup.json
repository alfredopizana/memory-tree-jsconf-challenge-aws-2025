Create the test file in the same directory with .test.{ts,tsx} extension\n2. Import the component/function being tested\n3. Set up basic test structure with describe block\n4. Include at least one basic rendering/functionality test\n5. Use React Testing Library for component tests\n6. Use Vitest for utility function tests\n7. Follow the existing test patterns in the project\n\nFor components, test:\n- Basic rendering without errors\n- Props are handled correctly\n- Key user interactions work\n\nFor utilities/services:\n- Core functionality works as expected\n- Error cases are handled\n- Edge cases are covered\n\nKeep tests focused and minimal - test behavior, not implementation details.",
